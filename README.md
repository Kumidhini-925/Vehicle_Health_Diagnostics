# Vehicle_Health_Diagnostics
Overview
The Vehicle Health Diagnostics project is an open-source initiative aimed at monitoring and analyzing vehicle performance and health. This repository provides tools and scripts to interface with a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) system, collect real-time data, and diagnose potential issues. The project leverages data from vehicle sensors, such as engine RPM, coolant temperature, and vehicle speed, to provide insights into vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and fault detection.
Features

Real-Time Data Collection: Connects to a vehicle's OBD-II port to retrieve live data.
Fault Detection: Identifies diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and potential vehicle issues.
Performance Analysis: Analyzes parameters like engine RPM, throttle position, and vehicle speed for performance insights.
Data Logging: Stores vehicle data for historical analysis and predictive maintenance.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports integration with various hardware (e.g., ELM327 adapters) and platforms.

Prerequisites
To use this project, you will need:

A vehicle with an OBD-II port (standard in most vehicles manufactured after 1996).
An OBD-II adapter (e.g., ELM327 with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi support).
A computer or smartphone with compatible software (e.g., Python, Android app).
Required software dependencies (listed in requirements.txt or equivalent).

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Kumidhini-925/Vehicle_Health_Diagnostics.git
cd Vehicle_Health_Diagnostics


Install Dependencies:If the project uses Python, install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If requirements.txt is not provided, common libraries may include python-obd, pyserial, or similar.


Usage

Run the Application:Start the main script to connect to the OBD-II adapter and begin data collection:
python main.py

Replace main.py with the actual entry point script if different.

Monitor Vehicle Data:

The application will display real-time data such as engine RPM, vehicle speed, and coolant temperature.
Check for diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) to identify issues.


Analyze Logs:

Data is logged to a specified file (e.g., vehicle_data.csv) for further analysis.
Use provided scripts or tools to visualize trends or detect anomalies.



Example
import obd

# Establish connection to OBD-II adapter
connection = obd.OBD()  # Auto-detects the adapter

# Query vehicle speed
speed = connection.query(obd.commands.SPEED)
print(f"Vehicle Speed: {speed.value}")

# Query engine RPM
rpm = connection.query(obd.commands.RPM)
print(f"Engine RPM: {rpm.value}")
